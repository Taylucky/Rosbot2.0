# Rosbot2.0

[Autonomous Rosbot Navigation Tutorial ](https://github.com/MissMeriel/ROSbot_data_collection/tree/master)

This repo implemented the entire machine learning pipeline in a real system, deploying the machine learning model onto a ROSbot robot car. This enables the robot to autonomously navigate without colliding with any obstacles.

Installation Steps: 

The rosbot 2.0 had melodic ros version which only supports Python 2. 
To use pytorch model, we decided to upgrade the Ros OS to noetic. The below link was used to flash the OS and upgrade it.
